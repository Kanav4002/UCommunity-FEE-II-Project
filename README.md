1. Introduction
1.1 Background
College campuses are dynamic environments where students and teachers engage in various academic and social activities. However, finding like-minded individuals for study groups, events, or social interactions can be challenging. Traditional methods of communication and organisation are often insufficient, leading to missed opportunities for collaboration and engagement.
1.2 Objectives The primary objectives of this project are:
To create a user-friendly platform for students and teachers to connect.
To provide personalised recommendations based on user interests and activities.
To enable users to create and join groups, discover events, and manage schedules.
1.3 Significance This project addresses a critical need in the college community by providing tools for better communication and organization. It aims to:
Foster collaboration and social interactions.
Enhance the college experience by providing a centralized platform for activities.
Promote academic success through organized study groups and events.
Improve accessibility and user experience with theme options.




2. Problem Definition and Requirements
2.1 Problem Statement Many college students and teachers lack effective tools to connect and collaborate on campus. Existing solutions often do not cater specifically to academic and social needs within a college environment, leading to missed opportunities for engagement.
2.2 Software Requirements
Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js
API Integration: Google Calendar API for event management
Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
Version Control: Git
2.3 Hardware Requirements
Any device with a modern web browser and internet connection
2.4 Data Sets
Sample user data for initial testing and demonstration
Real user data (securely handled) once the application is live

3. Proposed Design / Methodology
3.1 Overall Architecture [Include a diagram of your front-end system architecture here]
3.2 User Interface Design The UI is designed to be intuitive and engaging, featuring:
A dashboard with key activities and recommendations
Event creation and management forms
Group formation and management interfaces
Personalized profile and settings


3.3 Key Features and Algorithms
Recommendation Algorithm: Uses user interests and activities to suggest groups, events, and friends.
Event Management: Allows users to create, join, and manage events.
Group Formation: Facilitates the creation and management of study and social groups.
3.4 Theme Implementation (Dark and Light Mode)
CSS Variables: Use CSS variables to define color schemes for dark and light modes.
JavaScript: Implement a toggle switch to switch between themes and save user preference in local storage.
React: Create a ThemeContext to manage and apply themes across components.
