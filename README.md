1. Introduction
1.1 Background
College campuses are dynamic environments where students and teachers engage in various academic and social activities. However, finding like-minded individuals for study groups, events, or social interactions can be challenging. Traditional methods of communication and organization are often insufficient, leading to missed opportunities for collaboration and engagement.

1.2 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
	•	To create a user-friendly platform for students and teachers to connect.
	•	To provide personalized recommendations based on user interests and activities.
	•	To enable users to create and join groups, discover events, and manage schedules.

1.3 Significance
This project addresses a critical need in the college community by providing tools for better communication and organization. It aims to:
	•	Foster collaboration and social interactions.
	•	Enhance the college experience by providing a centralized platform for activities.
	•	Promote academic success through organized study groups and events.
	•	Improve accessibility and user experience with theme options.

2. Problem Definition and Requirements
2.1 Problem Statement
Many college students and teachers lack effective tools to connect and collaborate on campus. Existing solutions often do not cater specifically to academic and social needs within a college environment, leading to missed opportunities for engagement.


2.2 Software Requirements
	•	Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js
	•	API Integration: Google Calendar API for event management
	•	Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
	•	Version Control: Git

2.3 Hardware Requirements
	•	Any device with a modern web browser and internet connection

2.4 Data Sets
	•	Sample user data for initial testing and demonstration
	•	Real user data (securely handled) once the application is live

3. Proposed Design / Methodology
3.1 Overall Architecture
[Include a diagram of your front-end system architecture here]

3.2 User Interface Design
The UI is designed to be intuitive and engaging, featuring:
	•	A dashboard with key activities and recommendations
	•	Event creation and management forms
	•	Group formation and management interfaces
	•	Personalized profile and settings
3.3 Key Features and Algorithms
