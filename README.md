<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 Background</h3>
<p>College campuses are dynamic environments where students and teachers engage in various academic and social activities. However, finding like-minded individuals for study groups, events, or social interactions can be challenging. Traditional methods of communication and organization are often insufficient, leading to missed opportunities for collaboration and engagement.</p>

<h3>1.2 Objectives</h3>
<p>The primary objectives of this project are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To create a user-friendly platform for students and teachers to connect.</li>
    <li>To provide personalized recommendations based on user interests and activities.</li>
    <li>To enable users to create and join groups, discover events, and manage schedules.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Significance</h3>
<p>This project addresses a critical need in the college community by providing tools for better communication and organization. It aims to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foster collaboration and social interactions.</li>
    <li>Enhance the college experience by providing a centralized platform for activities.</li>
    <li>Promote academic success through organized study groups and events.</li>
    <li>Improve accessibility and user experience with theme options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Problem Definition and Requirements</h2>

<h3>2.1 Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Many college students and teachers lack effective tools to connect and collaborate on campus. Existing solutions often do not cater specifically to academic and social needs within a college environment, leading to missed opportunities for engagement.</p>

<h3>2.2 Software Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js</li>
    <li>API Integration: Google Calendar API for event management</li>
    <li>Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Version Control: Git</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Hardware Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Any device with a modern web browser and internet connection</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 Data Sets</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sample user data for initial testing and demonstration</li>
    <li>Real user data (securely handled) once the application is live</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Proposed Design / Methodology</h2>

<h3>3.1 Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>[Include a diagram of your front-end system architecture here]</p>

<h3>3.2 User Interface Design</h3>
<p>The UI is designed to be intuitive and engaging, featuring:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A dashboard with key activities and recommendations</li>
    <li>Event creation and management forms</li>
    <li>Group formation and management interfaces</li>
    <li>Personalized profile and settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Key Features and Algorithms</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Recommendation Algorithm:</strong> Uses user interests and activities to suggest groups, events, and friends.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Management:</strong> Allows users to create, join, and manage events.</li>
    <li><strong>Group Formation:</strong> Facilitates the creation and management of study and social groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.4 Theme Implementation (Dark and Light Mode)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CSS Variables:</strong> Use CSS variables to define color schemes for dark and light modes.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Implement a toggle switch to switch between themes and save user preference in local storage.</li>
    <li><strong>React:</strong> Create a ThemeContext to manage and apply themes across components.</li>
</ul>
